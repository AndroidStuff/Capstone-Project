# LaBuena Android App

LaBuena is a small family business to manufacture corn tortillas based on industrial machinery.

The process to deliver tortillas takes time, effort, and money. Currently those tortillas are sell at the branch
and from town to town in a truck with a special sound, so whoever wants tortillas
comes outside and buy them. Most of the time its just a wasting of gas traversing some towns without selling anything.

People buying tortillas at the branch have to walk some blocks, and make a line to finally get their tortillas.

Because of arriving of new competitors and low demand, the plan is to move LaBuena from the town to a bigger city.

This time the plan is to improve the distribution using mobile technology.

This application is designed to let the customer request their tortillas and based on location, deliver them as fast as possible in bikes.

Bikers will have an application to keep track of the places to deliver.

LaBuena will have an application to access the external stock, and pending orders to manufacture the required demand.
